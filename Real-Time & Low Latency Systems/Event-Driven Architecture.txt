1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design style where events (changes or actions) are the main way components communicate.
Each service emits events when something happens and reacts to events from others.

üîπ Core Concepts
Term	Meaning
Event -	A record of something that happened ‚Äî e.g. ‚ÄúOrderCreated‚Äù, ‚ÄúPaymentSuccess‚Äù.
Event Producer -	Component that publishes an event.
Event Consumer -	Component that subscribes and reacts to events.
Event Broker -	Middleware that routes and stores events (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
Event Stream	- Continuous flow of events in order over time.

‚öôÔ∏è Example (Spring Boot)
Producer
@Component
public class OrderService {
    private final ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public OrderService(ApplicationEventPublisher publisher) {
        this.publisher = publisher;
    }

    public void createOrder(Order order) {
        // business logic
        publisher.publishEvent(new OrderCreatedEvent(order));
    }
}

Consumer
@Component
public class NotificationListener {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Send confirmation email for: " + event.getOrder().getId());
    }
}


 This is in-process eventing. For distributed systems, we use Message Queues or Streams.

üì® 2. Message Queues (MQ)
 Definition
A Message Queue is a middleware that stores and forwards messages asynchronously between producer and consumer systems.
 Key Benefits
Decoupling ‚Äì producers and consumers don‚Äôt need to run at the same time.
Reliability ‚Äì messages are persisted until processed.
Load leveling ‚Äì smooth out traffic spikes.
Retry and acknowledgment support.

Common Technologies
Tool	Characteristics
RabbitMQ	Traditional message broker, supports routing, fanout, topics. Great for task queues.
ActiveMQ / Artemis	JMS-based brokers, often used in enterprise systems.
Amazon SQS / Azure Service Bus	Cloud-native queue services.
Example: RabbitMQ with Spring Boot
Configuration
@Configuration
public class RabbitConfig {
    @Bean
    public Queue orderQueue() {
        return new Queue("order.queue", false);
    }
}

Producer
@Service
public class OrderProducer {
    private final RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

    public OrderProducer(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate) {
        this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
    }

    public void sendOrder(Order order) {
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("order.queue", order);
    }
}

Consumer
@Service
public class OrderConsumer {
    @RabbitListener(queues = "order.queue")
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Processing order: " + order.getId());
    }
}


 Messages are persisted and retried automatically if consumer fails.

3. Data Streams
Definition
A data stream is a continuous, ordered, and unbounded flow of events.
Unlike a queue (message consumed once and deleted), streams retain data for a configured period ‚Äî allowing replay, reprocessing, and analytics.

 Common Tools
Tool	Use case
Apache Kafka	High-throughput distributed event streaming. Ideal for real-time pipelines, logs, analytics.
Pulsar	Multi-tenant, geo-replicated streaming platform.
Kinesis / Azure Event Hubs	Managed cloud streaming platforms.

Kafka with Spring Boot (Spring Kafka)
Producer
@Service
public class KafkaOrderProducer {
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    public KafkaOrderProducer(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    public void publishOrder(String orderJson) {
        kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", orderJson);
    }
}

Consumer
@Component
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events", groupId = "order-group")
public class KafkaOrderConsumer {
    @KafkaHandler
    public void consume(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received Order Event: " + message);
    }
}

                     EDA                      vs Message Queue    vs          Data Stream
Feature	     Event-Driven Architecture	         Message Queue	              Data Stream
Scope	      System design pattern	             Middleware                 	Middleware
Data retention	Depends on broker	Usually deleted after consumption	    Retained for hours/days
Use case	Decoupled communication	        Task processing	                 Event analytics, replay
Examples	Microservices,                  CQRS	RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ       	Kafka, Pulsar


 Real-World Use Case Example
E-commerce System (Event-Driven Architecture)
OrderService publishes OrderCreatedEvent to Kafka.
InventoryService consumes it ‚Üí reduces stock.
PaymentService consumes ‚Üí triggers payment gateway.
NotificationService listens ‚Üí sends email/SMS.

All communicate via Kafka topics asynchronously.
‚úÖ Benefits:
No direct service-to-service coupling
Each service scales independently
Can reprocess historical events for analytics

Key Spring Boot Tools & Libraries
Library	Purpose
Spring Events	In-process eventing
Spring Cloud Stream	Abstracts over Kafka/RabbitMQ
Spring Kafka / Spring AMQP	Direct integration for event-driven systems
Reactor Kafka	Reactive streaming APIs
Kafka Streams / Flink / Spark Streaming	Event processing & transformation pipelines

Best Practices
Use idempotent consumers (handle duplicate events safely).
Include event versioning and schema registry (Avro, JSON Schema).
Use DLQ (Dead Letter Queues) for failed messages.
Correlate events with trace IDs for observability.
For high throughput: batch processing + compression.
Apply backpressure and rate limiting when consuming streams.
