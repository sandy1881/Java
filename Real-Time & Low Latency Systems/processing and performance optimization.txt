1. What ‚ÄúReal-Time Processing‚Äù Means

Real-time processing means responding to incoming data immediately (or within a defined latency target).
There are two types:

Type	Description	Example
Soft real-time	Accepts small delays; aims for predictable low latency.	Stock price updates, chat apps
Hard real-time	Strict deadlines; failure = system failure.	Flight control, medical monitors

Most Java + Spring systems are soft real-time.

2. Core Patterns for Real-Time Data Processing
Event-Driven + Stream Processing

Use Kafka, Flink, or Spring Cloud Stream to consume continuous event streams.

@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class TransactionConsumer {
    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
    public void process(Transaction txn) {
        // process event in real-time
        fraudService.check(txn);
    }
}

Reactive Programming (WebFlux / Reactor)

Non-blocking I/O ensures threads aren‚Äôt waiting on slow operations.

@GetMapping("/prices")
public Flux<Price> streamPrices() {
    return priceService.getPriceStream(); // emits updates continuously
}

In-Memory Data Grids

Use Redis, Hazelcast, or Infinispan for caching and distributed in-memory computation.

3. Performance Optimization Layers
üîπ Application Layer (Code)
Area	Optimization
Avoid Blocking Calls	Use reactive APIs or isolate blocking code in bounded thread pools.
Batch Operations	Process events in batches (e.g. Kafka batch size).
Object Reuse	Reduce GC pressure (avoid unnecessary new allocations).
Asynchronous Processing	Use @Async, CompletableFuture, or Reactor‚Äôs Mono/Flux.
Efficient Serialization	Use Protobuf, Avro, or Kryo instead of JSON for hot paths.
Connection Pooling	Tune DB or HTTP connection pools (HikariCP, Netty).
üîπ Framework / JVM Layer
Setting	Best Practice
GC tuning	Use ZGC or Shenandoah for low pause; set -Xms = -Xmx.
Thread pools	Keep bounded; size = CPU cores √ó 2.
Profiling	Use JFR or async-profiler to find bottlenecks.
Logging	Use async appenders; avoid heavy formatting in hot paths.
üîπ Database & Cache Layer
Read optimization: Cache frequent queries (Redis, Caffeine).
Write optimization: Batch inserts, use async writes.
Indexing: Only where necessary; avoid over-indexing.
Connection pool: Size based on CPU √ó query latency.
üîπ Network & Serialization
Use binary protocols (Protobuf, Avro) over JSON.
Compress large payloads (gzip, snappy).
Set TCP options like TCP_NODELAY.
Use Netty/Vert.x for high concurrency, non-blocking IO.

4. Measuring and Monitoring
Tool	Purpose
Micrometer + Prometheus	Collect latency, throughput, queue size metrics.
Grafana	Visualize latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99).
OpenTelemetry / Jaeger	Trace request paths across services.
HdrHistogram	Capture fine-grained latency histograms.

5. Real-Time Processing Example Architecture

Key design elements:
Kafka handles event buffering + streaming.
Spring Boot microservices consume asynchronously.
Redis provides low-latency reads/writes.
Observability via Prometheus/Grafana ensures latency visibility.

6. Real-Time Tuning Checklist
Category	Key Action
Threads	Don‚Äôt oversubscribe CPUs; use non-blocking IO.
GC	Minimize allocations; use G1/ZGC.
Serialization	Compact formats; avoid reflection-heavy mappers.
Latency Monitoring	Track P99, not just averages.
Backpressure	Control input rate using Reactor or Kafka consumer configs.
Warm-up	Keep JVM hot (JIT compiled) for consistent latency.

7. Tools and Frameworks
Use Case	Recommended Tools
Event streaming	Kafka, Spring Cloud Stream, Flink
Reactive microservices	Spring WebFlux, Project Reactor
In-memory cache	Redis, Caffeine
Metrics & tracing	Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
Profiling	JFR, async-profiler, VisualVM
Testing	Gatling / JMeter for load & latency

Example: Parallel Sum with Optimization (Reactor + Parallel Flux)
List<Integer> numbers = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 1_000_000).boxed().toList();

long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

int sum = Flux.fromIterable(numbers)
              .parallel()
              .runOn(Schedulers.parallel())
              .reduce(0, Integer::sum)
              .block();

System.out.println("Parallel Sum: " + sum);
System.out.println("Time: " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) + " ms");
