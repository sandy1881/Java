1. Understand the Module Thoroughly
Review the module’s responsibilities and critical paths.
Identify all input/output points, edge cases, and failure scenarios.
Determine which parts are business logic versus external integration (DB, APIs, message brokers).

2. Focus on Testable Units
Isolate the core logic for testing. Avoid testing external systems directly.
If the module is tightly coupled, consider refactoring only for testability, e.g., inject dependencies instead of hardcoding them.
Keep changes minimal by using interfaces or dependency injection, not rewriting the module.

3. Use Mocking for External Dependencies
Mock databases, APIs, queues, or file systems so the module can be tested independently.
For Spring Boot, use @MockBean or Mockito.
Example:
when(repository.findById(1)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockEntity));
Ensures tests don’t depend on real services and module behavior can be reliably tested.

4. Cover Key Scenarios
Ensure you write tests for:
Positive paths – normal operations.
Negative paths – invalid input, exceptions, error handling.
Boundary conditions – min/max values, empty inputs, nulls.
Edge cases – concurrency, duplicates, or rare combinations.

5. Keep Tests Maintainable
Use descriptive test names:
testProcessPayment_ShouldReturnSuccess_WhenAmountIsValid()
Avoid changing the production code unless necessary for dependency injection or testability.
Keep helper methods inside test classes to reduce duplication.

6. Use Assertions Wisely
Assert both return values and side effects.
Include exception handling assertions:
assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> service.process(null));

7. Minimize Code Changes
Use wrappers or adapters for external systems instead of altering core logic.
Apply test doubles (mock, fake, spy) instead of rewriting module internals.
Only refactor small pieces if needed for dependency injection.

8. Measure Coverage
Use JaCoCo or IntelliJ coverage to ensure critical paths are tested.
Focus on branches and conditional logic over trivial getters/setters.

9. Automate and Integrate
Include the tests in CI/CD pipelines.
Run tests frequently to detect regressions early.
For critical modules, consider mutation testing to ensure test effectiveness.

10. Example Workflow
Identify a method in a critical module (e.g., processPayment).
List possible scenarios (success, failure, invalid input, exceptions).
Inject mocked dependencies (repository, API client, etc.).
Write separate test methods for each scenario using JUnit + Mockito.
Run coverage tool, ensure all branches are exercised.
Refactor only if absolutely needed for dependency injection.
Interview-style Answer Summary:
I start by identifying the critical paths and all edge cases. 
I isolate the module logic and mock external dependencies to avoid touching real services. 
I write unit tests covering positive, negative, and boundary scenarios, using descriptive names and proper assertions. 
I only make minimal changes to the production code for dependency injection if necessary. This approach ensures reliability, high coverage, and maintainability without rewriting or impacting existing logic.
