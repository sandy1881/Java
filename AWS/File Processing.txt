Step 1: File Upload and Storage
Service Used: Amazon S3

All files are uploaded to an S3 bucket.
S3 provides highly scalable and durable storage.
It can trigger events automatically whenever a file is uploaded.

Optimization Techniques
Use multipart upload for large files to improve upload speed and reliability.
Enable versioning to keep track of changes and backups.
Use S3 lifecycle policies to move processed files to cheaper storage (for example, from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier).
Apply S3 event notifications to trigger the next step automatically when a new file arrives.

Step 2: Event-Driven Processing
Service Used: AWS Lambda
When a file is uploaded to S3, an S3 event notification triggers a Lambda function.
The Lambda function performs processing such as
Image resizing
Data validation or format conversion
Extracting metadata
Sending notifications
Optimization Techniques
Use Lambda layers to reuse common code libraries.
Optimize Lambda memory and timeout configuration for the workload.
Split heavy processing tasks into smaller functions for better parallel execution.
Use Step Functions to coordinate multiple Lambda functions in sequence or parallel.

Step 3: Handling Large or Complex Processing
Service Used: AWS Step Functions or Amazon SQS with EC2 / ECS
If processing is too heavy for a single Lambda function (for example, large video processing or machine learning tasks), you can
Push file details into an SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue.
Use EC2 instances or ECS containers to consume messages from the queue and perform processing asynchronously.

Optimization Techniques
Use auto scaling in EC2 or ECS to handle workload spikes automatically.
Enable dead-letter queues in SQS to capture failed messages.
Batch process multiple files for better performance and cost efficiency.

Step 4: Storage of Processed Files
Service Used: Amazon S3 (separate bucket or folder)
Store processed files in another S3 bucket such as processed-bucket.
Use S3 lifecycle rules to move older processed files to Glacier for cost savings.
Use S3 cross-region replication for disaster recovery or global availability.

Step 5: Metadata and Tracking
Service Used: Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS
Store metadata such as file name, upload time, status, and output location in a database.
DynamoDB provides fast and scalable NoSQL storage suitable for such metadata.

Optimization Techniques
Use DynamoDB Streams to trigger additional actions when data changes.
Use Global Secondary Indexes for faster queries.

Step 6: Notification and Monitoring
Services Used: Amazon SNS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail
SNS sends notifications to users or administrators when processing completes or fails.
CloudWatch monitors the performance of Lambda, EC2, and other services.
CloudTrail logs all API activity for auditing and debugging.

Optimization Techniques
Set up CloudWatch alarms to detect processing delays or errors.
Use metrics to fine-tune Lambda concurrency and EC2 scaling policies.

Step 7: Security and Access Management
Service Used: AWS IAM
Create IAM roles and policies to control access to S3, Lambda, and other services.
Use least privilege principle to give only necessary permissions.
Enable server-side encryption in S3 for data security.
Use AWS KMS to manage encryption keys.

Benefits of This Optimized Design
Scalability: Automatically handles large volumes of files.
Serverless: Uses managed services to reduce maintenance.
Cost Efficiency: Pay only for actual usage.
Reliability: Durable storage and fault-tolerant design.
Security: Fine-grained access control and encryption.

Example Flow
User uploads a file to S3.
S3 triggers a Lambda function through an event.
Lambda reads the file, processes it, and stores the output in another S3 bucket.
Lambda writes file metadata to DynamoDB.
SNS sends a success or failure notification.
CloudWatch monitors the entire workflow.
