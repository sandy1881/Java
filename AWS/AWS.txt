Amazon Web Services also known as AWS is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
It offers a wide range of services that help individuals and organizations build, deploy and manage applications without having to maintain physical servers or data centers. 
AWS is one of the largest and most popular cloud service providers in the world.

Below is a detailed explanation of AWS and its major components
1. What is AWS
AWS is a collection of remote computing services also called web services that together form a cloud computing platform. 
These services provide infrastructure and software tools that can be used on demand. 
You only pay for what you use. This model is called pay as you go.
It allows businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand which saves cost and increases efficiency.

2. Types of Cloud Computing in AWS
There are three main categories of cloud computing services offered by AWS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
This provides basic infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, storage and networking. 
Example services include Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This provides a platform where you can develop, run and manage applications without managing the underlying hardware. 
Example services include AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Lambda.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
This delivers complete applications over the internet. Users do not manage infrastructure or platform. 
Example AWS services are Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon Chime.

3. Core AWS Services
1. Compute Services
These services handle application processing power and runtime environments.
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows you to run virtual machines.
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning servers. It is event driven.
Elastic Beanstalk is used to deploy and manage applications easily.

2. Storage Services
Used to store and manage data securely.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) stores data as objects in buckets.
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides block storage for EC2 instances.
Amazon Glacier is used for low cost data archiving.

3. Database Services
These services manage structured and unstructured data.
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) supports databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database used for high performance applications.
Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse used for analytics.

4. Networking and Content Delivery
Used to connect cloud resources securely and deliver content fast.
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) allows you to create a private network inside AWS.
AWS CloudFront delivers content worldwide using edge locations.
Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System service.

5. Security and Identity Services
Ensures user authentication and resource security.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) manages user permissions and access.
AWS Shield protects applications from DDoS attacks.
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) filters harmful traffic.

6. Management and Monitoring Services
Used to monitor and manage AWS resources.
AWS CloudWatch monitors system performance and metrics.
AWS CloudTrail records all API activity for auditing.
AWS Config tracks configuration changes in resources.

7. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Amazon SageMaker helps build, train and deploy machine learning models.
Amazon Rekognition analyzes images and videos.
Amazon Polly converts text into lifelike speech.

8. Developer Tools
Used for building and deploying software efficiently.
AWS CodeCommit is a source control service like Git.
AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests code automatically.
AWS CodeDeploy automates deployment of applications.

4. AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS has data centers spread across the world known as Regions and Availability Zones.
A Region is a physical location that contains multiple Availability Zones.
An Availability Zone is one or more data centers within a region.
This design provides high availability and fault tolerance.

5. Pricing Model
AWS follows a pay as you go model. You pay only for what you use without upfront cost.
There are three main pricing options

On Demand: pay for compute or storage by the hour or second.
Reserved Instances: pay in advance for long term usage at lower cost.
Spot Instances: bid for unused capacity at discounted rates.

6. Advantages of AWS
Scalability: resources can be adjusted as needed.
Reliability: multiple backups and high availability.
Security: strong encryption and compliance controls.
Flexibility: supports various operating systems and programming languages.
Cost effectiveness: no need to buy hardware.

7. Common Real World Uses
Hosting websites and web applications.
Data backup and storage.
Big data analytics and data warehousing.
Machine learning and artificial intelligence.
IoT applications and mobile backends.

8. Popular AWS Certifications
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner: basic level certification.
AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate: focuses on designing cloud architectures.
AWS Certified Developer Associate: focuses on building and maintaining AWS applications.
AWS Certified SysOps Administrator: focuses on deployment and management.

In summary AWS is a flexible, secure and scalable cloud platform that supports almost every business need from computing and storage to analytics and artificial intelligence. 
It has become the backbone for many companies across industries because it allows them to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.
