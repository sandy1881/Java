1. Core Security Goals
When designing the workflow, our main security goals are
Only authorized users or systems can upload files.
Processing functions can access only what they need — nothing more.
Credentials are never hardcoded or permanently stored.
Access is temporary and automatically expires after a defined period.

2. IAM Design for the Workflow
a. S3 Upload Permissions
Create a dedicated IAM role or policy for users or applications that upload files.
Allow only PutObject permission on a specific S3 bucket or folder.
Deny access to delete or read files unless necessary.

Example:
Allow: s3:PutObject
Resource: arn:aws:s3:::raw-file-bucket/uploads/*

b. Lambda Execution Role
Each AWS Lambda function must have its own execution role.
This role defines what the function can access.
For example, a processing Lambda needs permission to
Read from the input S3 bucket
Write to the output S3 bucket
Update metadata in DynamoDB

Example permissions for that role:

s3:GetObject
s3:PutObject
dynamodb:PutItem


It should not have permission to manage users, delete files, or access unrelated buckets.

c. SQS / SNS / DynamoDB Access Roles
If you use SQS, assign a role to allow SendMessage and ReceiveMessage actions.
SNS topics can have their own topic policies to allow only specific senders or subscribers.
DynamoDB tables should only allow PutItem, UpdateItem, and Query for the processing function.

3. Using Temporary Credentials
Instead of using long-term IAM user access keys, you can use temporary security credentials issued by AWS STS (Security Token Service).

a. What Are Temporary Credentials
Temporary credentials consist of
Access key ID
Secret access key
Session token
They are valid for a short time (for example, 15 minutes to 12 hours) and automatically expire.

b. How to Use Them
An authenticated user or application requests temporary credentials through AWS STS.
STS verifies the identity and issues credentials tied to a specific IAM role.
The user or app uses those credentials to upload a file or perform limited tasks.
c. Examples of Temporary Credential Use
For a Web Application
A user logs in to a web app using Amazon Cognito or your identity provider.
Cognito authenticates the user and provides temporary IAM credentials.
These credentials allow the user to upload a file directly to an S3 bucket without exposing permanent keys.

For Lambda or EC2
Lambda and EC2 automatically get temporary role-based credentials from IAM roles assigned to them.
They do not need to store access keys in the code or environment variables.

4. Integrating with Amazon Cognito for Secure Access
If your system has external users (for example, customers or partners uploading files), you can use Amazon Cognito.

How it Works
A user signs in through Cognito using username and password or Google / Facebook login.
Cognito verifies identity and assigns the user a role defined in IAM.
Cognito provides temporary credentials to the user.
The user uploads the file securely to the S3 bucket using those credentials.
This prevents you from having to share IAM user access keys with the public.

5. Additional Security Layers
a. Encryption
Use S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) for stored files.
Use AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to manage encryption keys.
Enable encryption in transit by requiring HTTPS (TLS).

b. Bucket Policies
Configure S3 bucket policies to allow access only from specific IAM roles or AWS accounts.
Deny any request that is not using SSL.

c. IAM Policy Best Practices
Follow least privilege — start with no access, then add only what is required.
Regularly rotate IAM roles and policies.
Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for users who can modify configurations.
Avoid using the root account for daily operations.

d. Auditing and Monitoring
Use AWS CloudTrail to record every API call.
Use CloudWatch to monitor metrics and detect unusual behavior.
Use AWS Config to ensure policies and roles stay compliant with your rules.

6. Secure Workflow Example
A user authenticates via Amazon Cognito and receives temporary credentials for uploading.
The user uploads a file to the S3 bucket using HTTPS.
S3 triggers a Lambda function using its execution role.
Lambda reads the file, processes it, and writes output to another S3 bucket using its temporary credentials.
Lambda updates DynamoDB metadata with the same temporary role.
SNS sends a notification — the SNS topic allows only Lambda’s role to publish messages.

7. Benefits of This Secure Implementation
No permanent credentials stored anywhere.
Each component has the minimum permissions required.
Automatic credential rotation through STS and IAM roles.
End-to-end encryption of data at rest and in transit.
Complete traceability through CloudTrail and CloudWatch.

In summary
You secure the workflow by
Using IAM roles instead of access keys.
Issuing temporary credentials via STS or Cognito.
Applying the least privilege principle to every service.
Enforcing encryption and auditing throughout the system.
