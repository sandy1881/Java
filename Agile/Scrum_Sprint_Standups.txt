1. Scrum Overview
Scrum is a lightweight Agile framework for managing complex projects. It emphasizes:
Iterative development in short cycles called Sprints
Transparency through daily standups and visible artifacts
Collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders

Key Roles in Scrum:
Role	Responsibilities
Product Owner (PO)	Defines vision, prioritizes backlog, represents stakeholders

Scrum Master	Facilitates Scrum events, removes impediments, ensures Scrum is followed

Development Team	Cross-functional team delivering the product increment


2. Sprints
Definition:
A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration (usually 1–4 weeks) where the team delivers a potentially shippable product increment.
Key Points:
Duration is fixed for all sprints in a project
Sprint goals are clearly defined during Sprint Planning
At the end of each sprint, the team holds a Sprint Review to demonstrate completed work

Sprint Lifecycle:
Sprint Planning – decide what work to do
Daily Scrum / Standups – 15-minute progress sync
Development Work – coding, testing, documentation
Sprint Review – demo work to stakeholders
Sprint Retrospective – reflect and improve process

3. Standups / Daily Scrum
Definition:
A standup is a short, daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) to synchronize the team.

Questions Typically Answered:
What did I do yesterday?
What will I do today?
Are there any impediments or blockers?

Benefits:
Keeps team aligned
Highlights risks early
Encourages accountability

4. Backlog Management
Definition:
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, tasks, and bug fixes that the team may work on in future sprints.

Key Points:
Managed by the Product Owner
Items are called User Stories
Each item has a priority, description, and sometimes story points (effort estimate)

Sprint Backlog:
Subset of the product backlog selected for the current sprint
Owned by the Development Team
Can evolve during the sprint but generally fixed once sprint starts
Prioritization Techniques:
MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t)
Value vs Effort Matrix

5. Scrum Artifacts and Visuals
Artifact	Purpose
Product Backlog	Full list of features/tasks
Sprint Backlog	Selected tasks for current sprint
Increment	Completed work meeting the Definition of Done
Burn-down Chart	Tracks remaining work in a sprint

6. Example Workflow
PO creates backlog:
"Search Movie" (High)
"Book Seats" (High)
"Payment Integration" (Medium)

Sprint Planning: Team picks "Search Movie" and "Book Seats"

Daily Standups:
Alice: Implemented search UI
Bob: Working on search API
Carol: Blocked by API issue
End of Sprint Review: Demo to stakeholders

Retrospective: Discuss what went well, what didn’t, improvements
