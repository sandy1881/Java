1. Working in Agile Teams

Agile teams are designed to be cross-functional, collaborative, and self-organizing.

Key Characteristics of Agile Teams:
Feature	Description
Cross-functional	Team includes all skills needed: developers, testers, designers, etc.
Self-organizing	Team decides how to accomplish tasks without heavy management oversight
Collaborative	Continuous communication between team members and with Product Owner/Stakeholders
Small and Focused	Typically 5–9 members for efficiency
Adaptable	Can quickly respond to changing requirements

Roles in an Agile Team:
Product Owner – prioritizes work and represents stakeholders
Scrum Master / Agile Coach – ensures team follows Agile practices and removes blockers
Development Team Members – execute tasks, share responsibilities, ensure quality

Team Practices
Daily standups for progress sync
Sprint planning, review, and retrospectives
Pair programming or peer review for better quality
Continuous collaboration with stakeholders for feedback

2. Iterative Development
Definition:
Iterative development is a process of building software in repeated cycles (iterations) instead of trying to deliver the complete product in one go. Each iteration delivers small, working increments of the software.

Key Points:
Each iteration is a short time-box (1–4 weeks, called a sprint in Scrum)
At the end of each iteration, the team delivers a working product increment
Feedback from stakeholders is incorporated in the next iteration
Allows for continuous improvement and adaptation

3. Iterative vs. Traditional Development
Feature	Iterative (Agile)	                                Traditional (Waterfall)
Delivery	Incremental, working software every iteration	One final delivery at the end
Feedback	Continuous	                                    Only after project completion
Change Management	Easy to adapt	                        Difficult and costly
Risk	Low, because issues are detected early	            High, issues found late
Documentation	Minimal but sufficient	                    Extensive upfront

4. Iterative Development Cycle
Plan – Define goals and backlog items for the iteration
Design & Build – Develop features planned for the iteration
Test – Test incrementally for functionality and quality
Review & Feedback – Demo to stakeholders for feedback
Reflect & Improve – Retrospective to improve next iteration
Each cycle feeds into the next, continuously refining the product.

5. Advantages of Agile Teams with Iterative Development
Advantage	Explanation
Faster Delivery	Working software is delivered early and often
Flexibility	Easy to adapt to changing requirements or priorities
Early Risk Detection	Issues are found and fixed early in iterations
Higher Quality	Continuous testing and feedback improve quality
Better Collaboration	Frequent communication aligns team and stakeholders
Customer Satisfaction	Stakeholders see progress regularly and influence the product

6. Real-life Example
Imagine an e-commerce website project:
Iteration 1 – Implement product search functionality
Iteration 2 – Add shopping cart feature
Iteration 3 – Integrate payment gateway
Iteration 4 – Add order tracking and notifications

After each iteration:

The team demonstrates the features to stakeholders
Feedback is collected and prioritized for the next iteration
The team improves both product and process in the retrospective

Summary
Agile Teams are collaborative, cross-functional, and self-organizing
Iterative Development breaks work into small cycles, delivering working software each time
Combined, they allow faster, adaptive, high-quality software delivery with continuous stakeholder feedback
